Currently, I'm a consultant with McKinsey, spending most of my time on pricing, commercial topics, and growth strategy across various industries. I also make [music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0POc51qA93i04mFERmQwTQ?si=cfda796578e645c6).

Before that, I worked in the [MJ Lab at Harvard Medical School](https://mj-lab.mgh.harvard.edu/), using machine learning and NLP techniques to study the effect of weather on COVID-19 transmission, the public's perceptions of such effects, and social media discussion of opioids.

I also performed math research at UNC-Chapel Hill with [Jeremy Marzuola](https://marzuola.web.unc.edu/) and [Tom Beck](https://sites.google.com/view/thomasbeck/home) in partial differential equations (namely, on [Laplacian eigenfunctions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFAcYruShow)), which resulted in a [joint publication](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00023-024-01424-3).

I studied math, computer science, and music at UNC-Chapel Hill.
